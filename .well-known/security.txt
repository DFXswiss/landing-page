# Note

It was decided to allow integration of DFX.swiss into external pages to support decentralization and cross-domain embedding. While aware of potential security risks (e.g., clickjacking), this model was chosen deliberately. Users are responsible for verifying transaction data, especially with non-open-source integrations.
